    "question": "What is the pH scale?",
    "referenceAnswer": "The pH scale is a measure of how acidic or basic (alkaline) a solution is. It ranges from 0 to 14, where 7 is neutral (pure water), values below 7 are acidic, and values above 7 are basic. Each unit represents a 10-fold change in acidity. pH stands for 'potential of Hydrogen' and is calculated as the negative logarithm of hydrogen ion concentration.",

    "question": "What causes earthquakes?",
    "referenceAnswer": "Earthquakes are primarily caused by the sudden release of energy stored in Earth's crust due to tectonic plate movements. When plates slide past, collide with, or separate from each other, stress builds up along fault lines. When this stress exceeds the strength of the rocks, they break suddenly, releasing energy as seismic waves that we feel as earthquakes.",
    "submittedAnswer": "Earthquakes happen when tectonic plates move and create pressure that suddenly releases, causing the ground to shake.",
